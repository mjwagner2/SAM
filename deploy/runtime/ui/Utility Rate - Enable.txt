An electricity rate which applies to purchased electricity can be enabled in the PPA Single Owner financial model to evaluate the impact of purchasing electricity from the utility to charge a battery.  Electricity that is generated by the system and sold to the grid is valued under the PPA agreement, while electricity purchased from the grid is valued under the electricity rate specified by enabling this option.  If this option is selected, it is assumed that there are two meters.  All site generation from the combined system will be sold to the grid under the PPA agreement using one meter.  All electricity purchased to meet site loads will be captured under a second meter operating under the electricity rate specified by enabling this option.
